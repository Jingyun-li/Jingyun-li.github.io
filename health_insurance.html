    <h1>Health Insurance Costs</h1>
    <p><strong>Impact of Demographics and Lifestyle on Premium Pricing</strong></p>
    <p> full project accessible below </p>
    <p>
      This study analyzes how demographic and behavioral factors — such as age,
      gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region — affect
      health-insurance charges for U.S. policyholders. Using statistical
      modeling and regression diagnostics, we examined whether these predictors
      can accurately forecast an individual’s expected premium cost.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Description</h2>
    <p>
      The dataset ($n = 1{,}338$, $k = 7$) was sourced from an anonymous U.S.
      insurer and published on Kaggle. It includes numerical variables
      (<i>age, BMI, charges</i>) and categorical variables
      (<i>sex, smoker, region</i>). These attributes capture the main
      policyholder characteristics relevant to premium pricing.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Age, BMI, and number of children are continuous predictors.</li>
      <li>Smoker status and region are categorical factors encoded as indicator variables.</li>
      <li>No missing values were detected; minimal cleaning was required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      Multiple linear regression models were fitted in <b>R</b> to estimate the
      relationship between insurance charges and demographic variables. Stepwise
      selection, partial F-tests, and Box–Cox transformations were used to
      refine model accuracy and verify the assumptions of linearity,
      homoscedasticity, and normality.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The initial full model achieved $R^2 \approx 0.75$ but showed non-normal residuals.</li>
      <li>Log-transformations and interaction terms ($\text{BMI} \times \text{smoker}$) were tested to improve fit.</li>
      <li>
        The final interaction model reached $R^2 = 0.84$ and adjusted
        $R^2 = 0.836$ ($p < 2\times10^{-16}$).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>
      Smoking status was the dominant factor, increasing charges by over 200%.
      Age and BMI also showed strong positive effects. Introducing the
      $\text{BMI} \times \text{smoker}$ interaction captured the nonlinear
      effect of BMI among smokers, substantially improving predictive accuracy.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
    <p>
      The refined model demonstrates that demographic and lifestyle variables
      can predict insurance charges with high reliability. Although residual
      normality remained imperfect due to right-skewed premium data, the model
      provides valuable insights for pricing strategies and preventive-health
      policy design.
