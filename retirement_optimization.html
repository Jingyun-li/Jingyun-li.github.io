        This project develops a quantitative model to generate <b>personalized retirement investment advice</b>
        for clients with varying income growth, age, and savings behavior.
        The model identifies the <b>optimal portfolio allocation strategy</b> that maximizes lifetime expected utility
        under uncertainty, using tools such as <b>stochastic dynamic programming</b> and <b>Monte Carlo simulation</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        The optimization framework combines <b>dynamic programming</b> with <b>stochastic market simulations</b>
        to determine an optimal year-by-year allocation strategy. The utility function penalizes shortfalls
        below retirement targets, balancing risk and reward over time. 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Dynamic Policy Modeling:</b> Each simulated path evaluates annual portfolio choices based on wealth, age, and expected return.</li>
        <li><b>Monte Carlo Simulation:</b> Thousands of correlated market outcomes are generated to approximate real-world uncertainty.</li>
        <li><b>Utility Optimization:</b> The objective maximizes expected lifetime utility while imposing downside risk constraints.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Simulation results show that investment strategies evolve naturally with <b>age, wealth, and proximity to retirement</b>.
        Younger clients allocate more toward growth-oriented portfolios, while older investors transition
        toward capital preservation. Clients exceeding their savings trajectory maintain stability,
        whereas those behind their targets adopt more aggressive allocations to catch up.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Wealth Sensitivity:</b> Higher wealth correlates with reduced risk-taking and lower fund volatility.</li>
        <li><b>Age Dependency:</b> Younger investors prefer equities and higher-volatility portfolios; older ones favor bonds and stability.</li>
        <li><b>Model Resolution:</b> Finer grid sizes and larger scenario counts yield smoother, more stable policy surfaces.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Insights</h2>
      <p>
        This study demonstrates how <b>quantitative methods can guide practical financial planning</b>.
        The integrated approach of stochastic dynamic programming and Monte Carlo simulation
        yields interpretable, data-driven investment strategies that align with <b>modern portfolio theory</b>
        and <b>lifecycle investing principles</b>. These models empower financial advisors and clients alike
        to make adaptive, informed decisions in uncertain markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, the project illustrates that <b>data-driven portfolio optimization</b> can translate theoretical
        models into <b>realistic, actionable retirement advice</b>â€”enhancing accuracy, risk awareness, and long-term
        financial stability.
